USC course scheduling is a complex task, with students facing a multitude of choices and constraints. They must navigate a large selection of courses, each with its own prerequisites, schedules, and availability, while adhering to major requirements and graduation timelines. This challenge is magnified by expanding course catalogs and intricate course dependencies, making manual scheduling difficult and often leading to conflicts and unmet academic goals.

The Trojan Scheduler project seeks to address this issue by leveraging data and algorithms to provide tailored, optimized schedule recommendations. This system aims to streamline the course selection process, considering individual academic paths and preferences. The goal is to make course planning more efficient, helping students craft schedules that align with their educational objectives. This report will explore the functionality, challenges, and benefits of the Trojan Scheduler in improving the academic journey for students.
